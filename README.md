## Overview
The mission of ThunderGBM is to help users easily and efficiently apply GBDTs and Random Forests to solve problems. ThunderGBM exploits GPUs to achieve high efficiency. Key features of ThunderGBM are as follows.
* Often by 10x times over other libraries.
* Support Python (scikit-learn) interfaces.
* Supported Operating System(s): Linux.
* Support classification, regression and ranking.

**Why accelerate GBDT and Random Forests**: A [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results) conducted by Kaggle in 2017 shows that 50%, 46% and 24% of the data mining and machine learning practitioners are users of Decision Trees, Random Forests and GBMs, respectively. 


GBDTs and Random Forests are often used for creating state-of-the-art data science solutions. We've listed three winning solutions using GBDTs below. Please check out the [XGBoost website](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/README.md#machine-learning-challenge-winning-solutions) for more winning solutions and use cases. Here are some example successes of GDBTs and Random Forests:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* cmake 2.8 or above | gcc 4.8 or above for Linux | [C++ boost](https://www.boost.org/) | [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 8 or above

### Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeyiwen/thundergbm.git
cd thundergbm
#under the directory of thundergbm
git submodule init cub && git submodule update
```
### Build on Linux 
```bash
#under the directory of thundergbm
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j
```

### Quick Start
```bash
./bin/thundergbm-train ../dataset/machine.conf
./bin/thundergbm-predict ../dataset/machine.conf
```
You will see `RMSE = 0.489562` after successful running.
